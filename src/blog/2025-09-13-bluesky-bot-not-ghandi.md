I made a little Python script to serve as Bluesky bot posting quotes that were not made by Ghandi. Not sure why, but here it is.

My programming experience is mostly in PHP and JavaScript. When I thought of making a Bluesky bot, I figured I'd try to do it in Python. This turned out to be a great choice, as there's a Python library to post to Bluesky, [atproto](https://atproto.blue). Not that I couldn't have done it in PHP with the [official API](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/category/http-reference), but it would have taken more than 3 lines of code I ended up using. In the end I spend more time collecting quotes than creating the script, which was done in half an hour. It's been running for a while now.

Oh, and for any Dutch people reading this, I've also created the ["Is het vrijdag"](https://bsky.app/profile/ishetvrijdag.bsky.social) bot, which posts every day to tell you if it's Friday of not (in Dutch).
